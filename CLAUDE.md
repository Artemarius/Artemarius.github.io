# Project Context for Claude Code

## What this is
This is my personal GitHub Pages portfolio/resume site, hosted at https://artemarius.github.io from the repo https://github.com/Artemarius/Artemarius.github.io

## Current state
- Single `index.html` file — fully self-contained (HTML + CSS + JS, no build tools)
- Dark theme with teal (#00d4aa) / blue (#0088ff) accent gradient
- Fonts: Outfit (display) + JetBrains Mono (code/labels), loaded from Google Fonts
- Features: fixed nav, animated background orbs + grid, scroll-reveal animations, responsive down to mobile
- Sections: Hero (with stat cards), Work Experience (timeline), Skills (tagged cards), Publications & Patents, Education, Contact
- No frameworks, no dependencies — pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- Deployed via GitHub Pages from main branch

## My background
I'm Artem Shamsuarov — Research & Software Development Engineer with 15+ years in C++/CUDA, computer vision, 3D reconstruction, SLAM, and real-time image processing. Based in Luxembourg. My full resume content is already in the index.html. I have my resume PDF attached to the project as well.

## What's coming next
- Visual polish and content improvements to the homepage
- Future project repos for ML/DL and Quant/HFT pet projects (not started yet)
- Eventually linking those projects from the portfolio

## Tech preferences
- Keep it simple: no build tools, no frameworks unless there's a strong reason
- Performance matters — minimal dependencies, fast load times
- Dark theme is the chosen aesthetic direction
